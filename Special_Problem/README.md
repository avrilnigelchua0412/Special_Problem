### Preprocessing

1. Polygon → Bounding Box Conversion
 - Some annotations are polygons; YOLO requires bounding boxes.
 - Conversion may introduce noise (e.g., elongated bounding boxes for irregular clusters).
 - Challenge: preserve accuracy while standardizing format.

2. Region Removal Logic (RRL)
 - Strategy for removing background noise or irrelevant regions.
 - Directly linked to problem in (1): bounding boxes may capture non-informative areas.
 - Idea: test filtering rules or preprocessing masks to clean training data.

3. Very Small Objects (<8×8 px)
 - Issue: YOLOv5/7/8 detect objects at feature map strides of 8, 16, 32 (sometimes 64).
 - At 640×640 input, the smallest grid cell corresponds to ~8×8 px.
 - Objects smaller than this often “disappear” in downsampling and are very hard to detect.
 - Source: Bochkovskiy et al. (2020, YOLOv4), Wang et al. (2023, YOLOv7), Ultralytics YOLOv5 docs. (**Read More**)
 - My current approach: treat extremely small thyrocyte boxes as noise and filter them out during preprocessing, since keeping them may hurt training more than help.
 - Future question: is removing these better than attempting to augment or oversample them?

4. Tiling Large Images
 - Problem: Original images are very high-resolution (~2000×2000). 
 - If downsampled directly to YOLO input size (e.g., 640×640), small objects like thyrocytes become invisible, and even clusters may lose detail.
 - Tiling = splitting images into smaller patches (e.g., 512×512, 640×640) to preserve local features.
 - This is different from YOLO’s grid (abstract, feature-map based). Tiling is a preprocessing step done manually before training.
 - Common in medical imaging to handle gigapixel pathology slides.
 - Hypothesis: Tiling may help highlight features (both clusters and thyrocytes) by keeping resolution higher.
 - Future direction: Evaluate if tiling improves detection vs. direct downsampling.

5. Tiling vs Non-Tiling
 - Large images (~2000×2000) can be fed directly (downsampled) or split into smaller patches (tiled).
 - Tiling preserves resolution of small features (e.g., thyrocytes), while direct downsampling may lose them.
 - In pathology research, tiling is common practice for high-resolution slides.
 - Plan: Train models on both untiled and tiled data, then compare results.
 - Goal: Determine if tiling provides measurable benefits for this dataset, given its specific microscope source.

### Modeling Approaches

1. Cluster-Only Model

 - Detect cell clusters exclusively.
 - Focus: adequacy assessment via presence/absence of clusters.

2. Thyrocyte-Only Model

 - Detect individual thyrocytes.
 - Hypothesis: capturing fine-grained features may improve generalization and reduce false negatives.

3. Segmentation Model (U-Net or Variants)

 - Alternative to bounding boxes.
 - Useful for pixel-level precision when clusters have irregular boundaries.
 - Still exploratory — requires further investigation.

### Technical Research Directions (Potential Publication)

1. Model Comparison
 - YOLOv5 vs YOLOv7 vs YOLOvX (Latest)
 - Goal: benchmark different YOLO versions for cytology data.
 - Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1, mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95.

2. Integration of Attention Layers

 - Reference: PI-YOLO: Dynamic Sparse Attention and Lightweight Convolutional-Based YOLO for Vessel Detection in Pathological Images (Li et al.).
 - Hypothesis: Attention improves detection of small/thin clusters in noisy slides.
 - Experiment: Add custom attention modules to YOLO backbone or head.

3. Segmentation with U-Net (or U-Net++/Attention U-Net)

 - Investigate U-Net’s applicability for FNAB cytology images.
 - Compare segmentation vs. detection in terms of adequacy evaluation.
 - May complement detection models rather than replace them.

### Microscope Effects:

1. The microscope and camera setup (magnification, lighting, resolution) can change how images look.

2. This may affect model performance — a model trained on one microscope’s images may not work as well on another.

3. For my future technical paper, the microscope type and settings should be reported.

### Class Imbalance:

1. There are far more thyrocytes (thousands per image) compared to clusters (only 1–2 digits per image).

2. This imbalance may cause the model to favor detecting thyrocytes while missing clusters.

3. Augmentation needs to consider this imbalance (e.g., oversampling clusters, careful augmentation strategies).
