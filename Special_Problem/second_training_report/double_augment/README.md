üìä Interpretation

Stable performance = preprocessing didn‚Äôt harm generalization.
The metrics are nearly the same, meaning the tiling filter (keeping only cluster-containing tiles) didn‚Äôt reduce the model‚Äôs ability to recognize thyrocytes or clusters. That‚Äôs good ‚Äî it means the filtering isn‚Äôt causing major bias or data imbalance issues.

Small recall gain for both classes suggests that the double augmentation/tiling strategy might have made cluster regions more visible (less background/noise).

Minor trade-off in precision (especially cluster class) indicates that the model is predicting slightly more positives, which is often fine early in medical detection ‚Äî recall is typically more valuable for identifying all potential diagnostic areas.

  After applying a filtering step that retains only tiles containing ‚Äúcluster‚Äù annotations, the YOLO model was retrained with identical   hyperparameters. The performance remained generally stable, with a slight improvement in cluster recall and mAP@50.
  
  This suggests that focusing training on diagnostically relevant regions (cluster-containing tiles) helps the model better detect target   structures without negatively impacting thyrocyte recognition.
  
  Furthermore, class imbalance was handled by assigning a class weight of 5.0 to ‚Äúcluster‚Äù and 1.0 to ‚Äúthyrocyte.‚Äù The same hyperparameter   configuration was used (refer to hyp.yaml).
